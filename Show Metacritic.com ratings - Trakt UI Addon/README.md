## Show Metacritic.com ratings - Trakt UI Addon

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/bPGgmMd.png)

### This is an "addon" script to [Show Metacritic.com ratings](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13858-show-metacritic-com-ratings) by cuzi. This script will not work without it.

This script reads the data provided by that script and displays it neatly in the Trakt infoheader instead of the little panel provided by Show Metacritic.com ratings.

This script hides the infopanel normally rendered by "Show Metacritic.com ratings" on Trakt by default. If you wish to not hide it, you can change this setting from the Tampermonkey dropdown.
