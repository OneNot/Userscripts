# Userscripts
**This repository is a collection of my userscripts to be used in a browser using a userscript extension such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).**

**This is not a complete list. I have plenty of other userscripts uploaded to [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/13303-1n07). I am transfering some of them here as I update them.**
