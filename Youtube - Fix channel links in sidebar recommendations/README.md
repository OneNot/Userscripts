<h1>Youtube - Fix channel links in sidebar recommendations</h1>
<b>Fixes the channel links for the "Up next" and recommendated videos below it on youtube.</b>

<h2>Known issues in v1.0.1:</h2>
Since the latest rounds of youtube updates breaking everything, I have managed to partially fix the script, but as of right now:
<ul>
<li>Links start working at a slight delay (from when the videos appear on page)</li>
<li>Firefox is not working. LibreWolf and Chrome work. Others untested.</li>
<li>The script does not work if you are signed out</li>
</ul>

<i>For whatever reason, youtube decided that you should no longer be able to click on a channel's name in the recommended videos (the sidebar on video pages) to go to that channel.
This script fixes that.</i>

<b>The channel will open to the /videos section by default.</b> This can now be changed. Just find the option in the Tampermonkey menu and click it.
