<h1>Youtube - Fix channel links in sidebar recommendations</h1>
<b>Fixes the channel links for the "Up next" and recommendated videos below it on youtube.</b>

<i>For whatever reason, youtube decided that you should no longer be able to click on a channel's name in the recommended videos (the sidebar on video pages) to go to that channel.
This script fixes that.</i>

<b>The channel will open to the /videos section by default.</b> This can now be changed. Just find the option in the Tampermonkey menu and click it.
