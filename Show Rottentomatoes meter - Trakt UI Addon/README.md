# Show Rottentomatoes meter - Trakt UI Addon

![screenshot](https://imgur.com/HC0zWya.png)

## This is an "addon" script to [Show Rottentomatoes meter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/35443-show-rottentomatoes-meter) by cuzi. This script will not work without it.

This script reads the data provided by that script and displays it neatly in the Trakt infoheader instead of the little panel provided by Show Rottentomatoes meter.
