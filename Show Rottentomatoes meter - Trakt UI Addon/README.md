## Show Rottentomatoes meter - Trakt UI Addon

![screenshot](https://imgur.com/HC0zWya.png)

### This is an "addon" script to [Show Rottentomatoes meter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/35443-show-rottentomatoes-meter) by cuzi. This script will not work without it.

This script reads the data provided by that script and displays it neatly in the Trakt infoheader instead of the little panel provided by Show Rottentomatoes meter.

This script hides the infopanel normally rendered by "Show Rottentomatoes meter" on Trakt by default. If you wish to not hide it, set `HideRottenTomatoesMeterPanel` to _false_ at the top of the script.
<sup>I'll probably add it as a proper menu option later when I can be bothered to do so...</sup>
